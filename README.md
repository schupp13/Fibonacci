# Fibonacci
Interview question

Problem Breakdown:
The task is to sum even-numbered Fibonacci numbers that are less than 1,000,000.

Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with:
`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...`
Where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Key Points:
1. We need to generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.
2. Only the even Fibonacci numbers should be summed.
3. Stop when the Fibonacci number exceeds 1,000,000.
